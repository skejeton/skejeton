Hello. I like C and C++ programming or trying something new, and just doing things for fun.
I'm working on a silly little game right now. Here's some projects I made:

*That game (https://github.com/skejeton/save-game)*

<p align="center"><img src="printf2.png" alt="Remote logging monitor"/></p>

*Remote logging monitor (https://github.com/skejeton/printf-on-steroids) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z66Afcwq5nk), made for a tool making jam*

*Pixel art program with infinite canvas (https://github.com/skejeton/compfy-paint)*

Etc..
